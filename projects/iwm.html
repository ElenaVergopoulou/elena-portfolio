        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          The project aimed to enhance the visitor experience at the Imperial War Museum through the design of an
          interactive kiosk focused on the V2 rocket exhibit. The final outcome was a <strong>Rocket Constructor and
            Simulator</strong>—a sensory, educational, and interactive experience enabling users to explore the history
          and evolution of rocket technology in a hands-on format.
        </p>
        <p>
          The kiosk experience was shaped by mixed-methods user research, user-centered design principles, and iterative
          prototyping. It combined passive and active learning modes to suit diverse visitor preferences, fostering
          emotional and educational engagement through storytelling and environmental simulation.

        <h2>Findings</h2>

        <h3>Immersive Experience</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Visitors strongly favored sensory features—citing earthquake or submarine simulators in other museums as
            benchmarks.
          </li>
          <li>
            Sound, vibration, and airflow were described as highly engaging, contributing to emotional immersion.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Learning & Information Preferences</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Learning was a core driver for both children and adult visitors, especially in family groups.
          </li>
          <li>
            Large blocks of static text were perceived as overwhelming and off-putting.
          </li>
          <li>
            Users preferred structured content delivered through visual storytelling or guided progression.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Interaction & Navigation</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The hands-on rocket construction phase was appreciated, but rigid drag-and-drop elements reduced enjoyment.
          </li>
          <li>
            Visitors valued having control over the experience—being able to choose between passive (watching) and
            active (building) paths.
          </li>
          <li>
            Story-driven navigation was praised for making the content more memorable and accessible.

      <section id="recommendations">
        <h2>Recommendations</h2>
        <p>
          The following recommendations emerged from observational research, interviews, and usability testing. They are
          grounded in user feedback and aligned with inclusive, engaging design principles tailored for a museum
          setting:
        </p>

        <h3>Increase Flexibility in Drag-and-Drop Interaction</h3>
        <p>
          Visitors found the Rocket Constructor engaging but occasionally restrictive. Introducing more freedom in
          element placement and clearer feedback cues would improve enjoyment and encourage creative exploration.
        </p>

        <h3>Reduce Cognitive Load with Visual Aids</h3>
        <p>
          Replace dense text blocks with visual storytelling elements—icons, images, and progressive disclosure.
          Chunking information and layering content would help users absorb key messages without feeling overwhelmed.
        </p>

        <h3>Improve Flow and Stage Transitions</h3>
        <p>
          Users occasionally lost context between construction, simulation, and reflection stages. Adding subtle
          transition animations or audio prompts would help reinforce narrative continuity and reduce friction.
        </p>

        <h3>Enhance Visual and Sensory Design</h3>
        <p>
          Future iterations should include richer illustrations, subtle animations, and tactile feedback elements (e.g.,
          sound, vibration) to elevate emotional engagement and replicate the positive reactions to sensory features in
          other exhibits.
        </p>

        <h3>Expand Post-Visit Engagement Options</h3>
        <p>
          Allow users to print or email their custom rocket designs and offer donation prompts tied to educational
          support. These actions would strengthen memory retention and visitor loyalty beyond the museum visit.
        </p>

        <p>
          These recommendations were designed with scalability in mind and could be iterated through stakeholder
          feedback, higher-fidelity prototyping, and continued user testing in a live exhibit environment.
        </p>

      <section id="outcome">
        <h2>Outcome</h2>
        <p>
          The final deliverable was a multi-stage interactive prototype designed for use in a museum kiosk. The Rocket
          Constructor and Simulator experience included the following elements:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Rocket Selection & Info Screen:</strong> Users explored 3D models of A/V-series rockets and accessed
            contextual historical content.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Rocket Construction:</strong> A drag-and-drop interface allowed users to build rockets while
            engaging with pop-up educational facts.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Sensory Launch Simulation:</strong> A multi-sensory experience including sound, vibration, and
            airflow effects to simulate a rocket launch.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Print & Donate:</strong> Users could 3D print their custom rocket or donate to support museum
            education initiatives.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The prototype was well received by tutors and peers for its originality, emotional depth, and alignment with
          museum constraints. It successfully met the project brief by delivering a hands-on, story-driven learning
          experience grounded in user research and inclusive design principles.

      <section id="reflection">
        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <p>
          This project deepened my understanding of how to balance emotional sensitivity with interactive design in
          museum contexts. Designing around a weapon of war—while honoring both history and human impact—required
          careful consideration in both tone and content.
        </p>

        <h3>What Went Well</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Applying ethical UX principles:</strong> We shifted the narrative focus from destruction to
            technological evolution, encouraging respectful curiosity over spectacle.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Interdisciplinary collaboration:</strong> Working with teammates from diverse backgrounds enhanced
            the experience design with varied pedagogical and emotional perspectives.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Visual storytelling:</strong> I led the creation of posters and storyboards that guided the user's
            emotional and educational journey through the kiosk.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Areas to Improve</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            While the low-fidelity prototype validated the concept and flow, a higher-fidelity version would better
            communicate visual design intentions and interactive depth.
          </li>
          <li>
            Expanding accessibility testing—especially for users with sensory sensitivities—would strengthen inclusivity
            in future iterations.
          </li>
          <li>
            Adding personalization features such as a “memory booklet” or post-visit souvenir could enhance long-term
            impact and engagement.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Overall, this project showed me the power of storytelling as a tool for education and empathy. It pushed me to
          think critically about how interactive media can inform, engage, and move people—especially in spaces where
          history and emotion intersect.
