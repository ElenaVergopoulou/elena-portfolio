  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>
    This qualitative research project explored how users plan leisure and travel activities using digital tools in both remote and in-person settings. Grounded in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) theory, the study applied two key frameworks‚ÄîMental Models (for remote, screen-based tasks) and Distributed Cognition for Teams (DiCoT) (for in-person, situated tasks).
  </p>
  <p>
    The goal was to uncover interaction patterns, identify usability breakdowns, and generate concrete, theory-driven design recommendations for future travel planning tools.
  </p>

      <section id="methodology">
  <h2>Methodology</h2>
  <p>
    The study used a two-pronged ethnographic method to explore how users plan leisure and travel activities in both remote and in-person contexts.
  </p>

  <h3>Remote Observations</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Conducted with three participants using platforms like Skyscanner, Omio, and Booking.com
    </li>
    <li>
      Sessions applied the <strong>Mental Models</strong> framework to examine user expectations, mismatches, prior knowledge, and adaptive behavior
    </li>
    <li>
      Participants verbalized thoughts using the <strong>think-aloud protocol</strong> while performing authentic planning tasks
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>In-Person Observations</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Conducted with three additional participants during situated decision-making (e.g., navigating museums, choosing a place to eat)
    </li>
    <li>
      Analysis followed the <strong>Distributed Cognition for Teams (DiCoT)</strong> framework, focusing on spatial layout, information flow, artefacts, and environmental constraints
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Analysis & Coding</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      All sessions were recorded and transcribed
    </li>
    <li>
      Manual thematic coding was performed using categories drawn directly from <strong>HCI theory</strong>
    </li>
    <li>
      Findings were mapped to design implications and structured into theory-informed recommendations
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    This mixed-context methodology allowed for a rich understanding of both cognitive and environmental factors influencing digital travel behavior.
  </p>
</section>



      <hr />
      <section id="findings">
  <h2>Findings</h2>
  <p>
    Analysis was divided between two frameworks‚ÄîMental Models (for remote screen-based use) and Distributed Cognition for Teams (DiCoT, for in-person tasks). Both highlighted recurring breakdowns in user expectations and revealed how users adapt to technological and environmental constraints.
  </p>

  <h3>Mental Models (Remote Observations)</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Expectations:</strong> Users anticipated familiar features like sort-by-price, filters by time or transport type, and consistent search behavior.</li>
    <li><strong>Mismatches:</strong> Unexpected results (e.g., fluctuating prices, missing filters, misleading map previews) created friction and confusion.</li>
    <li><strong>Adaptations:</strong> Users often shifted their strategy‚Äîswitching between transport modes, relaxing filters, or abandoning tasks mid-way.</li>
    <li><strong>Prior Knowledge:</strong> Familiarity with tools led to workarounds, like manually cross-checking prices on multiple platforms.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    <em>‚Üí Users followed the pattern: Expectation ‚Üí Mismatch ‚Üí Adaptation, suggesting that travel tools frequently violate users‚Äô mental models and require cognitive compensation.</em>
  </p>

  <h3>DiCoT Framework (In-Person Observations)</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Physical Layout:</strong> Decisions were highly influenced by immediate proximity (e.g., choosing the closest food option).</li>
    <li><strong>Artefacts:</strong> Visual tools like maps, star ratings, and user images became key decision triggers.</li>
    <li><strong>Information Flow:</strong> Users rapidly toggled across apps (e.g., Google Maps ‚Üí TripAdvisor ‚Üí Instagram) in real-time decision loops.</li>
    <li><strong>Social/Temporal Factors:</strong> Group consensus, time pressure, and social heuristics (e.g., ‚Äúmost reviewed‚Äù = ‚Äúmost trustworthy‚Äù) shaped actions.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    <em>‚Üí Decision-making was distributed across devices, tools, environments, and time‚Äîconfirming the applicability of the DiCoT model even in solo, real-world scenarios.</em>
  </p>
</section>

      <section id="recommendations">
  <h2>Recommendations</h2>
  <p>
    Based on the dual-framework analysis, the following design recommendations aim to improve usability, reduce cognitive friction, and align with real-world planning behaviors observed in both remote and in-person settings.
  </p>

  <h3>Recommendations from Mental Models (Remote Observations)</h3>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Align with User Expectations:</strong> Implement familiar filter and sort features (e.g., by price, duration, or rating) and ensure consistency across pages to reduce surprises.</li>
    <li><strong>Clarify System States:</strong> Clearly indicate when prices change, options are sold out, or filters reset‚Äîthis builds user trust and prevents confusion.</li>
    <li><strong>Support Flexible Adjustments:</strong> Enable users to switch between transport modes or trip criteria without having to restart the entire task.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Recommendations from DiCoT (In-Person Observations)</h3>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Enhance Spatial Awareness:</strong> Embed walking time or real-time travel estimates directly in listings to support situated decision-making.</li>
    <li><strong>Unify Information Sources:</strong> Integrate ratings and review summaries from third-party apps (like Google Maps or TripAdvisor) into the core interface to minimize app-switching.</li>
    <li><strong>Provide Time-Sensitive Feedback:</strong> Include dynamic alerts or visual cues when places may soon close or become unavailable, improving trust and reducing last-minute stress.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    These recommendations can inform the design of future travel planning tools‚Äîespecially those used in hybrid digital-physical settings‚Äîand are grounded in both cognitive and contextual insights from real users.
  </p>
</section>


      <hr />

      <section id="outcome">
  <h2>Outcome</h2>
  <p>
    This research project culminated in a comprehensive academic report that combined observational data, cognitive theory, and design practice to address real-world usability issues in digital travel planning.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Grounded insights into how users navigate planning tasks in both digital and physical environments</li>
    <li>Rich qualitative data‚Äîincluding transcripts and think-aloud sessions‚Äîcoded through Mental Models and DiCoT frameworks</li>
    <li>Actionable, theory-informed UX design guidelines for improving remote and situated interactions</li>
    <li>A clear demonstration of how HCI theory can support both academic understanding and practical interface design</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    The study validated the value of combining Mental Models and DiCoT to capture a holistic view of user experience‚Äîbridging internal expectations with contextual, embodied behavior. These outcomes offer transferable insights for designing hybrid travel tools that support planning, decision-making, and real-time adaptation.

      <section id="reflection">
  <h2>Reflection</h2>
  <p>
    This project helped me grow as both a UX researcher and a critical thinker. It challenged me to work across digital and physical contexts, interpret complex qualitative data, and apply abstract HCI frameworks in a grounded, actionable way.
  </p>

  <h3>What Worked Well</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Theory in practice:</strong> Applying Mental Models and DiCoT gave structure and depth to the analysis, revealing cognitive and contextual gaps that typical heuristics might miss.</li>
    <li><strong>Naturalistic observation:</strong> Capturing user behavior in real-world tasks uncovered nuanced decision patterns and workarounds.</li>
    <li><strong>Think-aloud insights:</strong> Participants' commentary exposed internal reasoning and frustrations that guided design recommendations.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>What I‚Äôd Improve</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Expand the participant pool to include more diverse travel needs and digital literacy levels.</li>
    <li>Test prototypes based on the recommendations to evaluate impact and feasibility.</li>
    <li>Use multimodal data capture (e.g., eye tracking, physical movement) in situated contexts for deeper analysis.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Most importantly, this project reinforced the value of designing systems that support how people think, move, and decide in messy, real-world conditions‚Äînot just how they interact with screens. UX research must meet users where they are‚Äîboth cognitively and contextually.
