          <h2>Overview</h2>
          <p>
            The Swim England UX case study presents a detailed usability
            evaluation of Swim England’s official website. Conducted within the
            scope of a university module, the project aimed to assess whether
            users could easily navigate the site, locate essential services, and
            understand its broader purpose.
          </p>
          <p>
            The research employed moderated usability testing sessions with five
            participants, covering key user journeys including volunteering,
            coaching, learning to swim, and using the PoolFinder tool. Findings
            were analyzed through structured qualitative methods, culminating in
            actionable recommendations to improve navigation clarity, label
            consistency, and overall user orientation.

          <h2>Recommendations</h2>
          <p>
            The final recommendations emerged directly from patterns observed
            across multiple users and were supported by behavioral evidence in
            the rainbow spreadsheet and annotated transcripts. These have been
            expanded with clearer design intent and practical next steps:
          </p>

          <h3>Clarify Website Purpose and Audience</h3>
          <p>
            Several users misunderstood the site’s intent, assuming it was only
            for beginners or parents. A clear homepage tagline such as:
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            “Swim England: Supporting swimmers, parents, coaches, and clubs
            across the UK.”
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            would help users orient themselves immediately and reduce cognitive
            load.
          </p>

          <h3>Streamline Navigation into a Single System</h3>
          <p>
            Issues stemmed from the presence of multiple menus (gray nav bar,
            homepage tiles, “Useful Links”). Merge into one coherent structure
            using dropdowns grouped by journey (e.g., “Start Swimming,”
            “Volunteer,” “Train to Teach”).
          </p>

          <h3>Re-label Ambiguous or Misleading Menu Items</h3>
          <p>
            Terms like “Awards” failed to convey progression stages. Replace
            with intuitive labels like “Swim Levels” or “Progression Stages.”
            Remove duplicates like multiple “Teachers” links to reduce
            confusion.
          </p>

          <h3>Signal Domain Transitions Clearly</h3>
          <p>
            Subtle changes in content and layout led to disorientation. Use
            background color shifts, breadcrumb trails, or subtitle banners to
            signal transitions between subdomains (e.g., “Learn to Swim”).
          </p>

          <p>
            These enriched recommendations directly address the observed pain
            points and are implementation-ready. In a real-world client context,
            I would follow up with low-fidelity wireframes and stakeholder
            testing to validate these ideas.

          <h2>Outcome</h2>
          <p>
            This project was part of a Master's-level HCI module and approved
            for external sharing with Swim England. It received strong feedback
            for:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Clear planning and structured execution</li>
            <li>Effective use of think-aloud and scenario-based testing</li>
            <li>Detailed behavioral analysis tied to project goals</li>
            <li>Well-organized and visually supported reporting</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The tutor highlighted the depth of usability insights and praised
            the report’s clarity. One area of improvement was the need for more
            visual or design-driven recommendations, which I’ve since addressed
            through this iteration.
          </p>

          <p>
            This outcome reaffirmed my interest in UX research and strengthened
            my ability to connect user insights to tangible design improvements.

          <h2>Reflection</h2>
          <p>
            This case study was a pivotal experience that challenged me to
            manage a full UX research pipeline. Key highlights include:
          </p>

          <h3>What Went Well</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Strategic test planning:</strong> Each task was aligned
              with a research goal. Separating open-ended exploration from
              functional tasks surfaced deeper insights.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Qualitative rigor:</strong> Manual coding, affinity
              mapping, and the rainbow spreadsheet enabled me to extract themes
              and validate issues across users.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>User empathy:</strong> Scenarios reflected real Swim
              England use cases, designed with inclusivity and clarity in mind.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Areas to Improve</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Incorporating SUS scores or confidence ratings would enrich the
              qualitative data with quantitative anchors.
            </li>
            <li>
              Initial recommendations lacked visual fidelity. In future
              iterations, I’ll supplement suggestions with mockups or annotated
              wireframes.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            This project reinforced the importance of research that’s not only
            methodical but also human-centered. It taught me that effective UX
            isn’t just about identifying friction—it's about translating those
            insights into clearer, kinder, more accessible experiences.
